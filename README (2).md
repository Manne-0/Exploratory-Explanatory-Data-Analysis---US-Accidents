# US Accidents Exploration
## by Chidinma Okoro


## Dataset

This is a dataset that contains car accidents countrywide, covering 49 states within the USA. This data has been collected from February 2016 to December 2021 through the use of multiple APIs that collect streaming traffic incident data, from government or state departments of transportation, private data providers, enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors that are utilized through the road-networks. This dataset contains currently about 2.8 million recorded observations, so it is a very large dataset to manage and manipulate.

## Summary of Findings

This dataset has data for 49 states in the US. There is no data for New York.

In US, California is the state with highest no. of road accidents in past 6 years. This makes ense as California is the most populated US state. Over 25% of the total accident records of past 6 years in US is only from California.

Florida is the 2nd highest (14% cases) state for no. road accidents in US.

Over 1000 cities recorded just one accident from 2016 to 2021. This seems off and needs to be investigated. Less than 5% of the cities have recorded more than 1000 accidents.

Accidents have peaked ever since the emergence of COVID, and has continued to increase exponentially. This increase is suprising. The reason for the surge may be due to the absense traffic officers.

A higher percentage of accidents occured between 1pm to 6pm, this could be as a result of closing hours and everybody is rushing to get home.

Next high percentage of accidents occurred between 6am to 8am this could probably be because of the morning rush to get to work. Accidents are more common during the weekday with friday being the highest than weekends.

Extreme temperature do result in more severe accidents. High number of accidents occured under moderate temperature.

There is a surge in accidents since the emergence of COVID 19. Over 70% of the total road accident records of last 6 years happened only within last 2 years (2020, 2021).

Temperature does not have much impact on the severity of the accident. However, extreme weather temperature, like below -50 F degree, usually only causes accidents that have a severity score of 2.
